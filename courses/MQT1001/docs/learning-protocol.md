# Math Learning Ergonomics Protocol

## 1. Define the Objective for Each Session

* Select one narrow target (e.g., conversions, sign rules, exponent properties).
* Avoid multi-topic sessions to reduce cognitive load.

## 2. Prepare Essential References

* Keep rules, formulas, and one worked example visible.
* Reduces working memory strain.

## 3. Structured Micro-Drills (Per Pomodoro)

### Warm-Up (3 examples)

* Copy model solutions to establish the pattern.

### Core Drills (5–8 problems)

* Same concept with slight variations.

### Challenge Drills (1–2 problems)

* Add one twist (mixed operations, different number forms, etc.).

## 4. Step-Trace Problem Solving

* Identify the form (decimal, fraction, exponent, percent).
* Identify required transformation.
* Apply the rule.
* Simplify.
* Check reasonableness.

## 5. Micro-Recall at the End of Each Pomodoro

* Close notes and solve 2 quick problems.
* If both correct: advance next session.
* If not: repeat the concept.

## 6. Daily Consolidation (10 Minutes)

* 2 problems from yesterday.
* 1 problem from last week.
* 1 problem from previous module.

## 7. Weekly Concept Map Reconstruction

* Rebuild connections between:

  * Number forms
  * Operations
  * Rules
  * Transformations
  * Financial math applications

## 8. Known Errors Log

* Track recurring mistake patterns (sign errors, dropped steps, simplification slips).
* Patch each with 3 focused problems.

## 9. Pomodoro Integration

* Standard: 25/5, long break after 4 cycles.
* Neuro-adapted: 15–20/5 if needed.
* Pair breaks with micro-movement and quick breathing reset.

## 10. Session Template

* Objective
* Preloaded references
* Drill set
* Micro-recall results
* Next-step note
