# Module 2 Exam Prep — Concept Focus

## Must-Know Concepts
- Order of operations (PEMDAS)
- Properties (commutative, associative, distributive)
- Negatives and parentheses

## Formula Recall (LaTeX)
- $a(b+c)=ab+ac$
- $(-a)b=-(ab)$
- Evaluate exponents before multiplication/division

## Typical Pitfalls
- Dropping parentheses during substitution or distribution.
- Rounding too early; keep exact forms until the final step.
- Sign errors with negatives, especially in inequalities.
