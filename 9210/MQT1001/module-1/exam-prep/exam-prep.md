# Module 1 Exam Prep — Concept Focus

## Must-Know Concepts
- Sets of numbers (ℕ, ℤ, ℚ, ℝ)
- Absolute value & distance
- Interval notation
- Rounding & significant figures

## Formula Recall (LaTeX)
- $\mathbb{N}\subset\mathbb{Z}\subset\mathbb{Q}\subset\mathbb{R}$
- $|a-b|$ is the distance between $a$ and $b$ on the number line.
- Interval notation examples: $[a,b],\ (a,b],\ [a,b),\ (a,b)$

## Typical Pitfalls
- Dropping parentheses during substitution or distribution.
- Rounding too early; keep exact forms until the final step.
- Sign errors with negatives, especially in inequalities.
