# Module 6 Exam Prep — Concept Focus

## Must-Know Concepts
- Ratio & rate
- Proportional relationships
- Slope-intercept form
- Reading simple graphs/tables

## Formula Recall (LaTeX)
- $\frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}\Rightarrow ad=bc$
- $y=mx+b$; slope $m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$

## Typical Pitfalls
- Dropping parentheses during substitution or distribution.
- Rounding too early; keep exact forms until the final step.
- Sign errors with negatives, especially in inequalities.
