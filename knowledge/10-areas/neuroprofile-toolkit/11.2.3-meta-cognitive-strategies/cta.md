## Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) — Developer Template

### 1. Target Outcome
A one-sentence definition of the final state when the task is complete.

### 2. Preconditions
List what must be known or available before starting:
- files to inspect
- API/spec references
- system prerequisites
- architectural constraints

### 3. Decision Points
Choices expected during the task:
- implementation path(s)
- design alternatives
- location of new code or modules

### 4. Information Sources
Exact references:
- docs
- test entry points
- notes
- prior commits
- issue links

### 5. Micro-Steps
Break the task into very small operations:
- inspect file
- locate function
- trace data flow
- sketch pseudocode
- implement subroutine
- run tests
- review diff
- commit

### 6. Verification Triggers
What confirms “done”:
- tests green
- linter clean
- expected behavior validated
- checklist or peer-review items met

### 7. Parking Lot
A list for ideas that arise but belong later.
