## SRP Loop — Micro-Playbook (Stop – Refocus – Plan)

### Trigger Conditions
Use SRP when:
- confused
- drifting
- over-debugging a detail
- losing the thread after a break
- context switching between tools

### Step A — Stop
Interrupt momentum.  
Hands off keyboard.  
One breath.

### Step B — Refocus
Ask:
1. What was the intended goal?
2. What is the smallest next action (≤ 5 minutes)?

If unclear, re-open the CTA.

### Step C — Plan
Commit to one bounded action:
- write the test stub  
- trace the variable path  
- refactor one helper  
- re-run tests  
- check the last diff  

### Anchors (Optional)
- after code compiles  
- after switching files/panes  
- after unexpected errors  
- after returning from a break
